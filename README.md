# dotfiles

These dotfiles are configured to be used with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

The newest configuration can be found in the hyprland folder which I use with Archlinux (...btw).

## Setup

Clone this repo, enter it and execute stow:

```bash
$ stow -d $PWD -t $HOME <subfolder>
```
